				<h4>PROGRAM DESIGN</h4>
	        	<p>Each client or athlete will get a program specalized for each ones needs under our supervision, also will be offered online programs  or take home programs only if  1 on 1 training isn't able to take place. This is also a tool that can be used for clients or athletes/teams that may need a program when traveling.</p>

				<h4>SPORTS SPECIFIC</h4>
	        	<p>This program is 5-6  days but can be mixed and matched for teams and athletes availability. This can be catered for middle school-professional athletes/teams of all levels.

				<h4>STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING</h4>
	        	<p>Strength â€“ the extent to which muscles can exert force by contracting against resistance (holding or restraining an object or person). Conditioning- the bodies ability to work easily and/or with lessened stress while performing a chosen activity or exercise. At BRP we combine the two and maximize each client or athletes goals by strength and condinditioning (systems of the body) with injury proventive exercises to reach the goal set. This is for athletes as well as are non athletes.</p>
