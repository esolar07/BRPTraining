		<h4>PERSONAL TRAINING & PROGRAM DESIGN</h4>
			<div class="hiddenCont">
        		<p>Personal training or what we call coaching or consulting is a three part process. First, set realistic goals and assist current fitness levels. Next, design a program for each client or athlete based on what is needed for that special persons.  Last, progress each client with proper nutritional advise and exercise routines with result driven methods.<br><br>Each client or athlete will get a program under our supervision, also will be offered programs online or for take home and training on own terms only if 1 on 1 training isnt able to take place. This is also a tool that can be used for clients or athletes/teams that may need a program when traveling.</p>

		<h4>SPORTS SPECIFIC TRAINING</h4>
			<div class="hiddenCont">
        		<p>BRPs theory is this, outside of baseball and soccer there are 4 quarters to most all big time sports games (Football, Basketball)  This program is 5-6  days but can be mixed and matched for teams and athletes availability.<br><br>This can be catered for middle school-professional athletes/teams of all levels. Each individual day will be broken into 4 quarters with overtime (mental prep) if needed at the end. Depending on that days focus, within each workout we focus on Speed, Agility and Power. This is also a program that will prepare athletes for there sport season, combine and pre-season conditioning test most teams or sports programs use.</p>
